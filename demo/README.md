## Install polymer tools

This needs to be done just once per machine.

```bash
npm install -g polymer-cli@1.9.7
```

**Note**: If EPERM errors occur then install polymer-cli using the
`--unsafe-perm` flag ( `npm install -g polymer-cli@1.9.7 --unsafe-perm` )
and/or using sudo.

## Build instructions

Create a standalone project using the contents of this directory as a base.

Then run:

```
npm install
polymer build
```

The 'polymer build' command needs to be run after each change to the source
code.

The output is created into the build/prod directory.

## Run instructions

### Option a) Use local web server and run directly in Chrome browser

To do this, first uncomment this line in src/rise-image.html

`// [ image01, image02, image03 ].forEach( el => RisePlayerConfiguration.Helpers.sendStartEvent( el ) );`

and run:

`polymer build`

Once build completes, run a web server locally, one could run the following commands:

```
cd build/prod
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8999
```

Then go to http://localhost:8999/src/rise-image.html in Chrome browser.


### Option b) Running the ChromeOS app in Chrome browser

To do this all the contents of build/prod may be uploaded to GCS,
with public permissions and no caching. To avoid CORS issues, the server
domain of the published file must be risevision.com.

Then create a schedule that points to the published file, for example:

  http://widgets.risevision.com/staging/pages/2018.XX.XX.XX.XX/src/rise-image.html

Note that this is an HTTP URL, as ChromeOS Player currently requires that.

Then configure the local environment as described in the
[Help Article](https://help.risevision.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020390692-HTML-Templates-Local-Development-Setup-and-Installation-Process). It's not necessary to point the schedule to a local URL as it's described there, with the above URL for the schedule is enough.
